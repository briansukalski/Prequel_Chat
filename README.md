# Prequel_Chat
Prequel Chatbot
Run the Prequel-Chat.py program to chat with the Star Wars prequels!

Instructions:
	Say whatever you want to the bot. It will respond with a quote from one of the three Oscar-worthy Star Wars prequel films.
	To stop chatting with the bot at any time, simply type "END" in the terminal.

	If you would like to chat with a specific character, simply type, somewhere in your response, some combination of "talk/chat/speak with/to",
	and then the name of the character you would like to chat with. 
	To return from a character-specific chat to general chat with all characters, type "return" as the user input
	You will chat with the selected character until you either end the chat, return to standard chat, or switch to a different character.

May the force be with you!
